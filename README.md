- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChefDamon, I'm an aspiring data analyst/ data scientist,
 still really new to it all but the community and new stuff I have been learning is amazing and I hope to land my first job soon.
 My background is in culinary arts, got a bachelor's in Applied Food Studies with a focus on anthropology, sustainability, and food policy.
 So far I have completed my Google Data Analytics professional certificate, a course on MySQL for BI on Udemy,
 and I'm currently working on another course on Udemy for R programming.
- 👀 I’m interested in SQL and R proframming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R and after I feel confident in R I would like to take up Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any progects that involve using R, MySQL or tableau
